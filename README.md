# Available placeholders:

**%session_seconds_played% – seconds of the current minute (0-59)**

**%session_minutes_played% – minutes of the current hour (0-59)**

**%session_hours_played% – hours of the current day (0-23)**

**%session_days_played% – number of days**

**%session_time_played% – formatted time (days, hours, minutes, seconds)**

**%session_time_played:seconds% – total seconds**

**%session_time_played:minutes% – total minutes**

**%session_time_played:hours% – total hours**

**%session_time_played:days% – total days**

It is ideal for plaques, scoreboards, and other plugins that support PlaceholderAPI.
